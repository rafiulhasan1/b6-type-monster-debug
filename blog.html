            <h1>Local storage vs session storage difference ?</h1>
            <p>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

            <h1>What is javascript in event loop ?</h1>
            <p>JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. This model is quite different from models in other languages like C and Java.The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an asynchronous task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will again check for any other tasks that need to be performed.</p>
